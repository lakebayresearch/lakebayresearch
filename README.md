- 👋 Hi, I’m @lakebayresearch
- 👀 I’m interested in quant research, operations research, trading systems and portfolio management. Learning new skills to help me with my current job 
- and future endeavours.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to put everything togather. Focusing on data science first than moving on to the analytics side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building out trading systems.
